# collections

# create an empty list? Array
# my_list = []
# my_list2 = list()

# print(my_list)

# create a list with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# add an element 24 to lst1

# add an element 12 to the start of lst1

# print(lst1)

# # print all values in lst2
# print(lst2)
# print(lst1[0])
# print(lst1[1])
# print(lst1[2])
# print(lst1[3])
# print(lst1[4])

# loop over the list using a for loop



# while loop


# List Comprehensions

# Create a new list containing the squares of all values in 'numbers'
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = []
# print(numbers)
# print(squares)
# Filtering with a list comprehension
evens = []

# create a new list of even numbers using the values of the numbers list as inputs
# print(evens)

# create a new list containing only the names that start with 's' make sure they are capitalized (regardless of their original case)
names = ["Sarah", "jorge", "sam", "frank", "bob", "sandy"]
s_names = []
# print(s_names)




# Dictionaries

# Create a new dictionary

# empty

# key value pairs

# access an element via its key



# Lets think about Tuples?
# this of an imutable list --> the tuple
# good for constant values
